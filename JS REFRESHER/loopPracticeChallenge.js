//1.  for loop + break

// Write a for loop that iterates through
// ["apple", "banana", "mango", "orange", "grapes"]
// Stop the loop when "orange" is found and store all fruits before it in an array called freshFruits./

// 2. for loop + continue

// Iterate through [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
// Skip numbers greater than 20 and store the rest in validNumbers

//3. for-of loop

// Use a for-of loop on
// ["react", "angular", "vue", "svelte"]
// Stop when "vue" is found and store previous frameworks in learnedFrameworks.

//4. for-of + condition

// Iterate over [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
// Skip numbers divisible by 3 and store the rest in filteredNumbers.

//5. for-in with object

// Given:

// let studentMarks = {
//   Math: 85,
//   English: 72,
//   Science: 90,
//   History: 65
// };


// Loop through the object and store only subjects with marks above 80 in a new object called topSubjects.

// 6. for-in + break

// Using the same studentMarks object,
// stop looping when "Science" is encountered and store previous subjects in checkedSubjects.



//7. forEach (understanding limitation)

// Iterate through
// ["html", "css", "javascript", "react"]
// Skip "css" and store the rest in webSkills.

// 💡 Reminder: forEach does not support break.

// 8. forEach + numbers

// Loop through [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
// Skip even numbers and store odd numbers in oddNumbers.




// 9. for loop + transformation

// Iterate through [5, 10, 15, 20]
// Skip 10, divide the rest by 5, and store results in dividedValues.




// 10. for-of + string length

// Iterate through
// ["pen", "notebook", "eraser", "calculator"]
// Stop when the word length exceeds 6 and store previous items in stationery.


// 11. Mixed Logic

// Using a loop of your choice:

// Iterate through [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]

// Skip 300

// Stop the loop if value is greater than 400

// Store results in finalValues
