# JavaScript Basics – Part 1 🚀

This folder contains my **foundational JavaScript learning and practice code**. It focuses on understanding **core JS concepts**, writing logic from scratch, and building a strong base before moving to **React.js and Next.js**.

---

## 📌 What This Folder Covers

This part is focused on **JavaScript fundamentals + early OOP concepts**, with practice-based learning instead of theory only.

## 🧠 Concepts Learned (Concept‑Wise)

### ✅ JavaScript Fundamentals

* Variables and data types
* Primitive vs non‑primitive behavior
* Functions and reusability
* Conditionals and logical flow
* Loops and iterations

### ✅ Arrays & Objects

* Array traversal
* Object creation and access
* Reference vs value comparison

### ✅ OOP in JavaScript

* Object literals
* Constructor functions
* Prototypes
* ES6 Classes
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Static methods
* Getters & setters

## 🎯 Why This Folder Matters

This code:

* Builds **strong JavaScript logic** (very important for interviews)
* Helps understand **how JS works internally**
* Prepares the base required for:

  * React Hooks
  * State & props
  * Next.js server logic
  * Clean code practices

---

## ⚠️ Important Learning Notes

* Prototype modification was practiced for **learning purposes only**
* In real projects, **native prototypes should NOT be modified**
* Composition is preferred over inheritance in UI frameworks like React

---

## 🧩 Interview Relevance

From this folder, interviewers can ask:

* Difference between primitive and non‑primitive types
* How prototypes work in JavaScript
* Difference between constructor functions and classes
* How `this` behaves in different contexts
* OOP concepts explained with JS examples
