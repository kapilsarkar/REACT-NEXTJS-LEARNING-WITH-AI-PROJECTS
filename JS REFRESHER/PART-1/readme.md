### JavaScript Refresher

This repository contains my JavaScript fundamentals refresher, covering core concepts that form the foundation for React, state management, and Full-Stack development.
The focus is on understanding JavaScript behavior, data types, and debugging techniques.

📌 Topics Covered
🔹 Console Methods

- Using console.table() with objects

- Improving debugging and data readability

- Understanding structured console output

🔹 Logical Operators

- AND (&&) – Returns true only when all conditions are true

- OR (||) – Returns true if at least one condition is true

- NOT (!) – Reverses the boolean value

🔹Use Cases

- Authentication checks

- Feature access control

- Conditional rendering logic

🔹 Data Types & Type Checking

- Number (primitive vs Number object)

- Boolean (primitive vs Boolean object)

- null vs undefined

- Symbol and uniqueness

- Using typeof for type checking

🧠 Key Learnings

- Difference between primitive values and wrapper objects

- Why typeof null returns "object"

- How Symbol ensures unique identifiers

- Understanding JavaScript’s type system behavior

🔹 Objects, Arrays & Mutability

- Objects and property mutation

- Arrays and indexed access

- Primitive vs non-primitive data types

- Mutability vs immutability

🔹 Type Conversion

- Explicit conversion using Number() and Boolean()

- JavaScript truthy and falsy values

- How JavaScript automatically converts types during operations

🧠 Key Learnings

- Objects and arrays are mutable

- Primitive values are immutable

- Different values behave differently when converted to numbers or booleans

🎯 Purpose

- Refresh JavaScript core concepts

- Build a strong foundation for React, Redux, and Node.js

- Improve debugging and logical thinking

- Write clean and predictable JavaScript code
